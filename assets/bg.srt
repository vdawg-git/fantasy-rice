1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,974
I am over here studying my tome.

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:06,893
I got ancient forbidden knowledge on my tome right now.

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:10,103
I'm just studying my tome.

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:13,368
I'm hunger for knowledge as fuck, man.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,945
<b>I am a dark wizard, man!</b>

6
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,366
Dark castle full of freaks,

7
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,150
chained hoes on the leash,

8
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:20,628
Mixing’ dirty potions, I’m the plug for the streets.

9
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,182
Unlicensed, untaxed,

10
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:23,207
I’m the king of the fiends,

11
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,785
Monkey minions running’ wild,

12
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:27,386
makin’ noise for the team.

13
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:32,521
So when the moon’s blood red

14
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,822
and the night's alive,

15
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:35,047
You know who runs the night,

16
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:36,953
who makes the darkness thrive.

17
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:38,257
I’m the villain, I’m the wizard,

18
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,600
I’m the king of the block-

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,311
In this castle of sin, I got the keys and the lock.

20
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:44,940
Let your gaze not meet mine

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,194
lest you be slain in a ride-by,

22
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,666
bisected in twain by halberds

23
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,150
as I come galloping

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,954
through town.
