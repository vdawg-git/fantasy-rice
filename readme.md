## To run the music visualizer:
- Start the Rust audio processor in the Rust folder
- Use a tool like Helvum to connect your audio output to the audio monitor node
- Load the plugin (you can also do that before)

## Assets used:
- Music: Low Income Barony by Burialgoods (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKNt3j-4bNg)
- Outro: I live in a low income barony by Burialgoods (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p86Q-tn5cXw)
- WoW UI textures from here: https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-textures
- Random WoW videos on YouTube (mostly ambience by https://www.youtube.com/@Meisio)

## Shout-out to:
- Vaxry for helping me with the music visualizer
- AI tools for giving me buggy code, but without them I would have struggled fr

Feel free to take any code to create something better from it
